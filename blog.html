      <h3>The Seeds of Square Roots</h3>
      <h4>
        Founded in 2016, Square Roots sprouted from a vision to bring fresh,
        healthy food to urban areas year-round. But it's not your typical farm.
        Instead, it's a technology-driven ecosystem that combines cutting-edge
        science, sustainable practices, and a dash of entrepreneurial spirit.
      </h4>
      <h3>Beyond the Greenhouse</h3>
      <h4>
        Square Roots isn't just about lettuce and tomatoes. It's a hub for
        agricultural research and development. Here's how they're branching out:
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Food Suppliers: Imagine grocery stores stocked with vibrant greens,
          regardless of the season. Square Roots partners with food suppliers,
          ensuring a consistent supply of fresh produce. Sustainability meets
          taste, and customers get a story worth sharing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Food R&D: Researchers and developers flock to Square Roots' indoor
          farms. Here, they explore plant behaviours, test novel approaches, and
          launch innovations. It's like a laboratory where kale meets curiosity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Healthier Harvests: Square Roots goes beyond calories and crunch. They
          focus on maximising beneficial compounds in plants—nutrients that
          boost human and animal health. It's not just about feeding bodies;
          it's about nourishing lives.
        </li>
      </ol>
